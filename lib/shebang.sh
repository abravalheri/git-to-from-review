#!/usr/bin/env bash

# The shebang is always controversial...
# Some systems have bash in /bin, others in /usr/bin (yet others at
# /usr/local/bin).
# Sometimes "/usr/bin/env bash" is used, with the advantage of enabling locally
# installed versions of bash to be used... But nothing ensures where env is
# placed.
# It seems widespread however the convention to have /usr/bin/env.
# Another widespread convention is to have at least /usr/bin/bash symlinked
# to /bin/bash.
